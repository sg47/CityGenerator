CityGenerator - Procedural City Generator
James Gu, Camilo King, Ben Wu

CityGenerator was written and can be compiled with Visual Studio 2010.

CityGenerator takes in user parameters and image maps and produces a model of a city (in .obj format).
CityGenerator can also output the road network (in the form of a MEL file for use in Maya), city blocks (obj),
or the building lots (also obj).

Usage:
/CityGenerator -f [Input File Name] -d [Density Map] -e [Elevation Map] -l [Legality Map]
If no input is specified, default inputs are used instead:

	Input: 		input.txt
	Density: 	density.png
	Elevation:	elevation.png
	Validity: 	legality.png

Image maps must be 512x512 and grayscale.

 - The input file specifies a number of parameters used by the city generator. Documentation on these to be added later.
 
 - The density map specifies the population density. Brighter areas are considered to have higher density than darker areas.
   Roads grow faster and lots are larger in high density areas.
   
 - The elevation map specifies the elevation. Brighter areas are considered to be higher than darker areas. Some roads will
   follow the elevation contours as they grow (i.e. they minimize elevation changes). Note that the output building
   geometry isn't actually offset vertically at this time, so the elevation map mainly serves to guide the shape of the road
   network.

 - The legality map specifies the areas that are illegal for road growth. Only black (RGB = 0,0,0) areas are considered illegal
   (i.e. roads with endpoints in illegal areas are pruned).  

Other usage information is printed to the terminal.
